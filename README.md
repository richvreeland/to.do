a task list for people who like to be both lazy and organized

Welcome to my blurry, dumb task app that doesn't care about days.

## Tasks ##
Tasks are timestamped and automatically move up over time.

- You can create tasks using shorthand. Try entering this up top: 'Ride the great wave. \pgw \y'
- You can use acronym shorthand for task categories, and time periods.
- Shorthand is always initialized with a back slash.
- Shorthand for time periods: 0 (this week), 1 (next week), 2 (two weeks), 3 or m (next month), 4 or q (next quarter), 5 or h (next half), 6 or y (next year).
- Shorthand for categories uses acronyms. So 'Project Great Wave' is \pgw. You can add special search terms for categories in categories.txt, which is where categories are customized. This is especially useful if you have categories with similar acronyms. It happens!

## Shortcuts ##
- 'f' to show/hide future events. '/' to start typing a new task!

## etc ##
- if you ever make a profound mistake, there is a cache of deleted and edited tasks, so fret not! currently lives in a txt file, but perhaps can make this into a 'recover' feature at some point.
